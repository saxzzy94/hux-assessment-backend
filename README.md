# Contact Manager Application

This is a Node.js application built with Express and MongoDB for managing contacts using Domain Driven Design Achitecture. It provides user authentication and CRUD operations for contacts .

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed Node.js (version 14.x or later)
* You have a MongoDB instance running (local or remote)
* You have npm installed

## Installing Contact Manager Application

To install the Contact Manager Application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   https://github.com/saxzzy94/hux-assessment-backend.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Configuring the Application

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
2. Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```
   Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB connection string and `your_jwt_secret` with a secure random string for JWT token generation.

## Running the Application

To run the Contact Manager Application, follow these steps:

1. Start the server:
   ```
   npm run start:dev
   ```
2. The server will start running on `http://localhost:5000` (or the port you specified in the .env file).

## Using the Contact Manager Application

The application exposes the following API endpoints:

* POST /api/signup - Register a new user
* POST /api/login - Login and receive a JWT token
* POST /api/contacts - Create a new contact (requires authentication)
* GET /api/contacts - Get all contacts for the authenticated user
* PATCH /api/contacts/:id - Update a specific contact
* DELETE /api/contacts/:id - Delete a specific contact

To use these endpoints, you'll need to include the JWT token in the Authorization header of your requests (except for signup and login).

This project uses the following main dependencies:

* express: Web application framework
* mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool
* jsonwebtoken: JSON Web Token implementation
* bcryptjs: Library for hashing passwords
* cors: Middleware to enable CORS
* dotenv: Module to load environment variables from a .env file

You can find the complete list of dependencies in the `package.json` file.
